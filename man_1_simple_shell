.Nm
simple_shell is a simple implementation of the standard command interpreter for the system that receives comands from the standard input or a file. This version has many features that make it similar in some aspects to the standard shell, but it is
a simple program to learn its operation. Only some standard shell features have been incorporated. This manual page is not intended to be a tutorial or a full specification of

.Sh ARGUMENTS
The first argument is assumed to be the name of a file containing 
.Nm
commands. The 
.Nm
reads and executes commands from this file, then exits. 
.Nm
's exit status is the exit status of the last command executed in the script. If no commands are executed, the exit status is 0. An attempt is first made to open the file in the current directory, and, if no file is found, then the 
.Nm 
searches the directories in PATH for the script.
